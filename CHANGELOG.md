## [3.0.0] - 2021-01-25

### Added

- DhcpServerDsc
  - Added automatic release with a new CI pipeline ([issue #59](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DhcpServerDsc/issues/59)).
  - Conceptual help is now generated for each resource on build.
  - Added new resource DhcpServerBinding ([issue #55](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DhcpServerDsc/issues/55)).
  - Added new resource DhcpServerExclusionRange ([issue #7](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DhcpServerDsc/issues/7)).

### Changed

- xDhcpServer
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The minimum PowerShell version is 5.0.
- xDhcpServerAuthorization
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The resource is now a single instance resource so
    that it is only possible to use the resource once in a configuration
    with the parameter `Ensure` set to either `Present` or `Absent`
    ([issue #40](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DhcpServerDsc/issues/40)).
  - The helper function `Get-IPv4Address` was changed from using `Get-WmiObject`
    to `Get-CimInstance` when fetching the enabled IP addresses.
- xDhcpServerOptionDefinition
  - The logic in `Test-TargetResource` was changed somewhat to remove
    unnecessary evaluation of properties that `Get-TargetResource` already
    did. The function `Get-TargetResource` calls `Get-DhcpServerv4OptionDefinition`
    with `OptionId` and `VendorClass` and if an object is returned the property
    `Ensure` is set to `'Present'`, so there are no point for `Test-TargetResource`
    to evaluate those two properties again.
  - Added unit tests for the function `Test-TargetResource`.
  - Reordered the resources in alphabetical order in the README.md.
- DhcpServerOptionValue
  - Added -Force flag to all Set-DhcpServerV4OptionValue calls to resolve errors
    when unnessesary validation is performed by the Cmdlet.
    ([issue #56](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DhcpServerDsc/issues/56))

### Removed

- BREAKING CHANGE: Removed the deprecated resource xDhcpServerOption which
  has been replaced by other DSC resources ([issue #46](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DhcpServerDsc/issues/46)).
- Removed the file `TestSampleUsingAzure.ps1` as it was not a working example
  of running integration tests.

### [2.0.0.0] - 2018-07-25

- BREAKING CHANGE: Switch to ScopeId as a key property for xDhcpServerScope
  ([issue #48](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DhcpServerDsc/issues/48)).
